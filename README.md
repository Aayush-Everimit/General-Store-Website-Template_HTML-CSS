All-in-One General Store - Static Webpage This repository contains the source code for a static webpage for the "All-in-One General Store." This project was created to demonstrate layout and styling skills using pure HTML and CSS, featuring a multi-section design with unique visual elements.

Features Multi-Section Layout: The page is organized into distinct sections including a welcome banner, address and promotions, and detailed product listings.

Product Categorization: Items are neatly sorted into categories like "Fruits," "Vegetables," and "Other Items" for clarity.

Fixed Promotional Offer: A sticky "Exciting Offer" box remains visible on the screen as the user scrolls, drawing attention to special deals.

Custom Styling: The design uses a specific color palette, box shadows, and text effects to create a unique, retro-inspired look.

Interactive Form: Includes a simple "Rate Us" form for user feedback.

Technologies Used HTML5: For the fundamental structure and content of the webpage.

CSS3: For all custom styling, layout management (including flexbox and positioning), and visual effects.

How to Use Download: Clone or download the index.html and Stylesheet3.css files from this repository.

Organize: Make sure both files are in the same folder.

Open: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the live site.

Customize: You can edit the HTML and CSS files in any code editor to modify the content, products, or styling.

This project is a great example of creating a complex, visually distinct webpage using foundational web technologies.
